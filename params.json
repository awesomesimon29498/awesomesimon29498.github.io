I also like to create stuff on my own, so don't be fooled.\r\n\r\n### Redesign\r\nSometimes, when I feel that something doesn't quite fit my taste, I will redesign it and put it on my Github. For example, I have already redesigned one of my school's sites. \r\n\r\n### Creating\r\nI don't just redesign stuff that other people made, I also create and redesign some of my own stuff! I will create software in multiple different languages such as HTML, Python, Java, JS, C++, and etc. \r\n\r\n### About me\r\nI am a middle schooler at SFS, and currently, I am a beginner in programming, so don't judge me. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact me at twitter, facebook, and instagram.
